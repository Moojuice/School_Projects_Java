 ~~~~~BASIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR GAME~~~~~
 Our game plays mostly like a normal game of set, with a few modifications.
 
 To start the game, you will need to enter a name and however many players are going to play. Every player who wants to join
 must select the same number of players for the game. (Ex: for a 3 person game, every person selects 3) 
 Press start to wait for other people. 
 
 In the game itself you need to press Call Set before clicking on your set. Take too long, 
 or make an invalid set and you are penalized. Other people must wait while you try to call a set.
 
 At the end of the game, if none of the players cannot find any more sets, a majority needs to agree to press Add Cards
 in order to end the game.
