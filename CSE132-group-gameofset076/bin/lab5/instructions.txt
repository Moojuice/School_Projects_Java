 ~~~~~BASIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR GAME~~~~~
 Our game plays mostly like a normal game of set, with a few modifications.
 
 To start the game, you will need to enter a name and however many players are going to play. Every player who wants to join
 must select the same number of players for the game. (Ex: for a 3 person game, every person selects 3) 
 Press start to wait for other people. 
 
 In the game itself you need to press Call Set before clicking on your set. Take too long, 
 or make an invalid set and you are penalized. Other people must wait while you try to call a set.
 
 The add cards button is your way of saying "I don't think any sets can be made with what's on screen, so can we
 draw from the deck?" Cards will be added once a majority of players push the add cards button, which is similar
 to how it would work when playing set with real people.
 
 The game doesn't end until everyone agrees there are no sets to be found. This means the game will keep going until
 either there are no cards left in the field, or until a majority agrees that they can't find a set and pushes the
 add cards button when there are no cards left in the deck.  
 
 You cannot join a game that is already in progress. If you disconnect while a game is running, 
 and join again, you will be put into a new, different game.
 
 Have fun with it!
